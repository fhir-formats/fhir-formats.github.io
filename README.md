## Synopsis

This is a website powering an [online demonstration](https://fhir-formats.github.io) of the [FHIR Formats Lua library](https://github.com/vadi2/fhir-formats).

## Motivation

This website allows users to easily transform between HL7 FHIR XML and JSON formats in realtime, without the need to send the resource to a FHIR server and downloading it back.
